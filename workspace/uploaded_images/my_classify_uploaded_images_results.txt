For the test "Classify Uploaded Images" 4 images were uploaded:
1) Dog_01.jpg - image of a dog, breed - Akita
2) Dog_02.jpg - Dog_01.jpg rotated by 180 degrees
3) Elephant_01.jpg - image of an elephant
4) Car_01.jpg - image of a car

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
If not, report the differences in the classifications.
VGG: eskimo dog, husky
ALEXNET: eskimo dog, husky
RESNET: eskimo dog, husky
All three model architectures classify the breed of dog to be the same. The eskimo dog and husky breeds look like Akita breed. 
 
2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? 
If not, report the differences in the classifications.
VGG: borzoi, russian wolfhound
ALEXNET: cardigan, cardigan welsh corgi, corgi
RESNET: pembroke, pembroke welsh corgi, corgi
None of three model architectures classify the breed of dog to be the same as for Dog_01.jpg. 
The result of VGG is closer - borzoi and russian wolfhound breeds look like Akita breed. 

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.
All three model architectures classify Elephant_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg as not dogs.

Elephant_01.jpg:
VGG: african elephant, loxodonta africana
ALEXNET: tusker
RESNET: tusker

Car_01.jpg:
VGG: sports car, sport car
ALEXNET: racer, race car, racing car
RESNET: sports car, sport car

Only VGG model correcly identified that Elephant_01.jpg is an elephant. The Car_01.jpg was correctly identified as a car by all three model architectures.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. 
Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification. 

VGG classified the uploaded images better since the results of classification of both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg were closer to the actual breed 
and classification results of Elephant_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg was correct.
